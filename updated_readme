This program is now finished, it's designed to work with the real data pulled from mentor and mentee surveys. Matching is based on three separate 
categories. This first is a list of 26 categories that mentees were allowed to choose from that they may be interested in learning about, and
mentors could choose from if they felt comfortable teaching. The score for this categorie is a simple calculation where overlapping items
are worth a single point, and they're divided by the total number of items that the mentee is interested in learning about. The second category
comes from six standard competency categories which mentors and mentees were both asked to prioritize in order of what they most want to
learn (mentees) or what they feel they're most equipped to teach (mentors). Onle the top three priorities were considered, and the matching
items were divided by 3 to give a percent. These two scores were combined with a weighting of 60% going to competencies and 40% going to the first
category. Finally, demographic data was considered. If the mentor or mentee indicated that they cared about being paired with somebody of
the same demographic with regard to langauge, gender identity or race/ethnicity, then their responses for these categories were compared. Because
participants were allowed to type into these categories manually rather than selecting pre-written choices, the matches were difficult,
and mismatches will need to be spot-checked manually to determine if they're falsely negative. Future iterations of this program may include
regular expressions to reduce the amount of false negatives. I had no input with regard to survey design, or I likely would have
collected data little bit differently, but the program is currently functional and automates the majority of the matching process.
